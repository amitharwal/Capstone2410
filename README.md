# Capstone2410
Download the "capstone.py" file and run it in an IDE like VScode or PyCharm. It should generate all five graphs using matplotlib. As seen in the presentation, I have attached all five screenshots of said graphs. I have also attached the presentation file. Thank you! - Aryan Mitharwal
